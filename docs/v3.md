## Strapi v3 installation

```bash
npm install strapi-plugin-point-list@3.0.0
```

Component by default is not going to appear in the UI. You need to enable it manually. To enable the component in any content type you've to add the attribute in a configuration model json file (*.settings.json) at `api/example/models/example.settings.json`:

```diff
{
  "attributes": {
    "path": {
-      "type": "string",
+      "type": "pointlist",
+      "columnType": "text"
    }
  }
}
```

> Consider setting the "columnType" parameter to "longtext" or some other data type supported by your database.

After successful installation you need to rebuild the strapi admin panel.

```bash
npm run build && npm run develop
```
